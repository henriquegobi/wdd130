      <h3>Network</h3>
      <p>
      Why will people come to this site?
      </p>
      <p>
      This site is designed for those studying higher education who need to find and build a good network. Maybe you may feel alone and can’t find people from the same Degree course and country as yours. Want international relationships? We provide tools and a friendly platform to help you find others to introduce and discuss topics from your course.
      </p>
      <p>
      How can I find others from the same course as me?
      </p>
      <p>
      Sign up and tell us about your degree, country, period, and all the time expected to end up your course. We will match you with others from the same course, and from whatever country you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do other students find me?
      </p>
      <p>
      As mentioned before, you insert your personal information about yourself. You will get a user ID that you can share receive or request friendship to others. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Can I join other university groups I am not part of?
      </p>
      <p>
      Yes, the UFBoard collects and stores the users information and matches it with the same university and courses. Even so, the user can join other university groups if wanted but the relevance points are only granted when you help students from the same university as yours.
      </p>

      <h3>Relevance Sistem</h3>
      <P>
      Participate, be seen.
      </P>
      <p>
      The site will provide a discussion board. Each participant can open new discussions about troubleshoots they are facing. This can be used by any student from any course this site registered. If you are a lawyer student you can open discussions with others from the same course. The same with software engineering students, maybe you want to share a code with your friends and mates so that they can help fix and improve your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the Relevance Sistem?
      </p>
      <p>
      As much you participate in discussions and solve others’ questions you became more relevant, this means you grow in the site as much you participate and help others. As receive relevance points, you will also have achievements in the platform and receive titles others can recognize and seek for your help.
      </p>
      <p>
      Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
      </p>
      <p>
      Imagine you are a university freshman and need help from a tutor to help you with your questions. For some reason, you didn’t have it and need someone else’s help. This site is intended to provide connections to find others in the platform who is member of the UFBoard too. Veterans and freshman can meet and make new friends.
      </p>
      <p>
      With our system of relevance and we provide a professional academic platform for students. Any student can seek help from each other, schedule appointments, and see what they are facing in their activities.
